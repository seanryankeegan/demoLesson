##CSS intro

#### The basics
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- It's a design language that describes how the HTML elements are going to look.
- It allows you to set "rules" for lots of elements at once.

### Why do we use them?
- It saves time!
- It's faster, both to develop and to load.  Each HTML tag doesn't need it's own style applied.
- Easier to maintain.  You can make global changes easily.
- Helps make websites look good on different platforms (computer, tablet, phone)

####Other facts
- It's best practice to create an external style sheet to organize your CSS.
- The format is:

  Selector {
    property: value;
    property: value;
  }

  Example:
  h1 {
    background-color: red;
    text-align: center;
  }
